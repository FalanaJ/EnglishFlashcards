# English Flashcards Game

**Description**

I would like to show you my application for learning English words.  I spent 3 solid days working on it, but I think it was worth it because I will definitely use it during the academic year.

As you can see, the application is in sea colors, so calm and pleasant to the eye, the first photo shows how everything is described to a new user so that he knows what is going on.

The next ones show the operation of the program itself - we enter the word in English below its Polish equivalent and press the "Confirm answer" button OR press the ENTER button, which I am very proud of because it makes it much easier for someone who wants to go through it quickly.

Below it will be displayed whether we are right or wrong, if not, the correct form will be displayed.  There are buttons to exit the program and to reset after completing the approach.  Interestingly, the program will react when we do not put the file with our words into the appropriate folder and the system does not find it.  It won't let us just start approaching.

To add your words to learn you have to modify MyEnglishWords.txt file and write words like on the photo below.
